Nut Free Macaron Ingredients
140g (4.94 ounces) or 4 egg whites
72g (2.54 ounces) or 1/3 cup caster sugar
240g (8.47 ounces) finely grated white chocolate
120g (4.23 ounces) or 1 cup icing sugar sifted

Nut Free Macarons Directions

1)Whisk together your egg whites and sugar until stiff, add colour if desired and whisk through.
2)Egg whites should be stiff enough that you can turn your bowl upside down and it will not spill out of the bowl.
3)Gently fold in your icing sugar and white chocolate. 
4)Once it is just combined continue to fold some more until some mixture dropped into the bowl very slowly melds down into the rest of the mixture.
5)You do not want a runny mixture or your macarons will be flat. 
6)Pour the mixture into a piping bag or ziploc bag with the corner cut off and pipe circles onto non-stick baking paper.
7)Bake at 150 degrees C for approximately 20 minutes.
8)I like to bake on the top shelf for 15 and then move down for the last 5 – 10 as needed.
9)Leave to cool on the paper and then carefully peel off.
10)Pair similarly sized macrons and fill with ganache. 
11)The recipe should make about 20 macarons.

Chocolate Ganache Recipe
150g (5.29 ounces) dark chocolate chopped
50g (1.76 ounces) or 3 tbsp plus 1 tsp cream

1)Place chocolate in a bowl. 
2)Bring the cream to the boil and pour over the chocolate.
3)Wait approximately 3 minutes for the chocolate to melt and then stir until smooth.
4)Place in a ziplock bag in the fridge until firm enough to pipe – it thickens as it cools.
